dry approach?
why to convert jsx to js?
react vs reactdom?
what happens if i only include reactdom n not react?

jsx attribute vs react attributes?

components?
types of components? 
difference between elements,components,instance?

stateful vs stateless component?
:component(input: props+state)===>elements

why are component named capitalised?
::: to help JSX to distinguish between custom component & build -in component 
React.createElement('div'.{})
React.createElement(Model,{}) 

rendering dynamic data? 
input,textarea,button click 
event handler,state management,hooks

reconccilation?
the process that react use to decide which part of dom elkements need re-rendering .

controlled vs uncontrolled component?


React encounter React element with identical types and props , then the states of the react elements are internal n same 
on event been associated to a react element (click on the 1 of them) will cause a state change but that state change is internal , so no ui updates on re-render also.
SO USE PROPS +KEY to disguish each react element n minimal n optimal dom updation.

event handler vs callbacks?
usestate what it returns? a function ands default value for starter 





JSX WORKING?

boilerplate code?
